It contains constructors for each "domain concept" to tag Node_s with via API.

{-| Program is created by the Runtime.program function.
It requires:
- initial root node (stateMachine)
- editor (top-level function to transform a domain model to a cell model)

Just an root node of variant StateMachine.

Using the Editor-API, one can stick together cell-based editors.

  * with an input cell containing the "name" property of the state machine

        Carries the input parameters and the update function itself to be evaluated in the editor update

{-| If our statemachine does not contain any events, we put a placeholder cell to allow the user to add events
Otherwise, we map over all events and create editor cells for them.
The event editors themselves are wrapped by two constant cells ("events" and "end")
